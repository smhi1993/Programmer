#Vacuum World

This is some work to replicate the Vacuum Cleaner World described in _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ 
by Russell and Norvig. This is a Python program.

The Vacum Cleaner agents are aware of their immediate environment, but are not very complex. The most advanced version included in this repository is one that operates in 
a rectangular room of unknown size. It starts in one corner and finds its way to the opposite, 
thereby determining the layout of the room. It then follows a spiral path to ensure it visits every square of the room, 
ending up somewhere near the middle. It then takes the shortest path back home and shuts itself down.

##Installation

Fork it, copy it, then type Vacuum.py at the command line prompt.
